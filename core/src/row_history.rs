//! Per-table, per-rowid VERSION HISTORY over a `SQLite` database's WAL temporal
//! model — the evidence-based "row history" (Phase 1 of the WAL-temporal work).
//!
//! [`Database::row_histories`](crate::Database::row_histories) walks each salt
//! epoch's [`CommitSnapshot`](crate::CommitSnapshot)s in commit order, then the
//! final live view, and for every rowid emits the sequence of distinct record
//! values it held — an `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/reinsert history reconstructed
//! purely from the bytes, with NO timestamps (SQLite WAL carries no wall-clock
//! time; `commit_seq` is LOGICAL order within an epoch only).
//!
//! The two correctness-critical transforms are pure and unit-testable here:
//! [`build_rowid_versions`] collapses identical consecutive values into one
//! version (labelled by the EARLIEST view it appeared in) and classifies each
//! version's [`ViewState`] from evidence; the same walk detects rowid REUSE (a
//! present→absent→present-with-a-different-record gap is a delete+reinsert, two
//! entities, never one continuous update).
