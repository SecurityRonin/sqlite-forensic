//! Freeblock-aware in-page cell reconstruction, validated against the REAL
//! Nemetz SQLite Forensic Corpus (DFRWS-EU 2018; CC0). See task #56 and
//! `docs/recovery-comparison.md` ("Freeblock reconstruction").
//!
//! When SQLite frees an in-page cell it converts the cell into a **freeblock**:
//! the cell's first four bytes are overwritten with the freeblock header (2-byte
//! next-freeblock offset + 2-byte freeblock size). That clobbers the cell's
//! payload-length and rowid varints AND the record header's first byte(s)
//! (`header_len` + the leading serial type). A forward parse from the freeblock
//! offset therefore recovers nothing for that cell — the dominant FN class.
//!
//! [`Database::reconstruct_freeblock_records`] closes the gap: it derives the
//! table's record-header template from a LIVE cell on the same page (column
//! count, header length, and the serial types of the leading columns that fall
//! inside the clobbered prefix), then walks the page's freeblock chain and
//! reconstructs each freed cell from its **surviving** serial-type tail plus the
//! template. The rowid is destroyed, so it is emitted as unknown (`0`).
//!
//! Precision discipline (the whole point — see task #56): a reconstructed
//! candidate is only emitted when its body decodes cleanly AND fits inside the
//! freeblock bounds. The reconstructed values are scored exactly like any other
//! carved record, and the forensic layer's live-row filter still drops any that
//! collide with a live row — so reconstruction never re-surfaces a live row.
